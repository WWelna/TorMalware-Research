# Tor Malware Research
This is some old Proof of Concept code involving seeing if it's possible to make a compact Tor client for usage in Malware.

## Notes
The theory behind this Proof of Concept is many of the listed Tor relays and Exit Nodes have port 9050 open, which is the SOCKS5 proxy used to "access" the Tor Network. By scanning for them, and keeping a list of reliable ones with high uptime, you can in effect, make a primative Tor Client that can connect to a hidden onion service to send and receive data. This is the result of that research into this, and likely no longer works without a lot of reworking of the code, as it's from 2011, and I have no desire to update any of the code to working status.

This was a precursor to [Pandora-OOC](https://github.com/WWelna/Pandora-OOC) with the usage of OOC methods to obfuscate the executable.

## Build Instructions
It uses [TCC](https://bellard.org/tcc/) and that's about it as far as I can remember.
